# Analyzing the Determinants of Condo Unit Prices in Downtown Toronto

This econometrics project aims to identify the characteristics of condo units that significantly influence their prices in Downtown Toronto. Using linear regression analysis and employing Heteroskedasticity-Robust Standard Errors, we ensured the accuracy and reliability of our findings. For a comprehensive understanding of the project, please refer to the attached [.pdf file](R_Abbasi_U_Condo_Unit_Project.pdf), which offers a detailed report. Additionally, you can explore the [.Rmd file](Abbasi_U_Condo_Unit_RCode.Rmd) to access the R code used in the analysis, providing a deeper insight into the employed methodology.
