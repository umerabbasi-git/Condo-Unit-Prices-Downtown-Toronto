# ANALYZING THE DETERMINANTS OF CONDO UNIT PRICES IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO

In this econometrics project, I utilized linear regression analysis to identify the crucial characteristics of condo units that significantly influence their prices in Downtown Toronto. By employing Heteroskedasticity-Robust Standard Errors and addressing any model violations, I ensured the accuracy and reliability of my findings. For a comprehensive understanding of the project, please refer to the attached [.pdf file](R_Abbasi_U_Condo_Unit_Project.pdf), which offers a detailed report. Additionally, you can explore the [.Rmd file](Abbasi_U_Condo_Unit_RCode.Rmd) to access the R code used in the analysis, providing a deeper insight into the employed methodology.
